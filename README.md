# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Tymoteusz**, a Robotics Engineer and Student based in Warsaw, Poland.

My main tech stack is **C++**, **Python**, and **ROS 2**. I spend most of my time working with **Linux**, simulating robotic worlds, and tinkering with embedded hardware like **Raspberry Pi** & **ESP32**.

I'm currently a Junior Robotics Engineer and an active member of the **Student Robotics Association (KNR)**.
