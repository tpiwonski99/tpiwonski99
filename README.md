# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Tymoteusz**, a Robotics Engineer and Student based in Warsaw, Poland.

I bring robots to life using code and electronics. If it moves—whether on wheels or four legs—I probably want to program it.

My main tech stack is **C++**, **Python**, and **ROS 2**. I spend most of my time working with **Linux**, simulating robotic worlds in **O3DE** & **Isaac Lab**, and tinkering with embedded hardware like **Raspberry Pi** & **ESP32**.

I'm currently a Junior Robotics Engineer at **Smarttech3D** and an active member of the **Student Robotics Association (KNR)**.
