# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Tymoteusz**, a Robotics Engineer and Student based in Warsaw, Poland.

I bring robots to life using code and electronics. If it moves—whether on wheels or four legs—I probably want to program it.

My main tech stack is **C++**, **Python**, and **ROS 2**. I spend most of my time working with **Linux**, simulating robotic worlds in **O3DE** & **Isaac Lab**, and tinkering with embedded hardware like **Raspberry Pi** & **ESP32**.

I'm currently a Junior Robotics Engineer at **Smarttech3D** and an active member of the **Student Robotics Association (KNR)**.

I've worked on various systems, but my favorite projects are the **Meldog** (a quadruped robot where I built custom pressure sensors) and **Vaporeware** (an interactive art installation powered by neural networks).

**Fun Facts:**

* 🤖 I was an extra in a TV commercial for the Ministry of Education (pretending to build robots, which I actually do!).
* 🌍 I was an exchange student in Malta and the UK.
* 🖨️ I love 3D printing and designing mechanical parts in CAD.
* **Hobbies:** Robotics, electronics, and travel.
